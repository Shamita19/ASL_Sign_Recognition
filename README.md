# ASL Sign Recognition Project

## Overview

This project aims to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) signs using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create an application that can interpret and translate ASL gestures into text, making communication more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## Features

- Real-time ASL sign recognition using a webcam.
- Translation of ASL gestures into text or speech.
- Support for a variety of ASL signs (e.g., alphabet).
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Ability to add and train custom signs.

## Project Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains images used for training the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training and real-time implementation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
